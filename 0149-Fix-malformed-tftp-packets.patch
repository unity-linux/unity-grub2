Subject: [PATCH 149/194] Fix malformed tftp packets

0088-Normalize-slashes-in-tftp-paths.patch collapses multiple contiguous
slashes in a filename into one slash in the tftp packet filename field.
However, the packet buffer pointer is advanced using the original name.
This leaves unitialized data between the name field and the type field
leading to tftp errors. Use the length of the normalized name to avoid
this.
